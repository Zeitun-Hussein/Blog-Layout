            <h2>Blog Post Title 1 _Antiaspirants</h2>
            <p>Antitranspirants
 
                Antitranspirants are substances applied to plants to reduce water loss. There are 
                three types of antitranspirant, film‑forming compounds, stomatal regulators and 
                reflective compounds.
                 
                The first type of antitranspirant contains film‑forming compounds. These 
                compounds are oils or waxes that are mixed with water to form an emulsion. 
                This emulsion is then sprayed onto the leaves of plants. The emulsion forms a 
                physical barrier that covers the stomata. The film is designed to prevent water 
                loss but allow gas exchange. Scientists have found that that the film‑forming 
                antitranspirant is effective in increasing yield and increasing photosynthesis 
                in drought conditions. The increased leaf turgor in plants sprayed with film, 
                compared to control plants, shows that the film decreases water loss and 
                maintains turgor in drought conditions.

            <h2>Blog Post Title 2_Heart Transplant</h2>
            <p>A heart transplant is an operation to replace a damaged or failing heart with a 
                healthy heart from a donor who has recently died. In the United Kingdom, 200 
                heart transplants are carried out each year. 
                 
                A heart transplant may be considered if you have severe heart failure and medical 
                treatments are not helping. Conditions that may eventually require a heart 
                transplant include coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathy, where the walls of 
                the heart have become stretched, thickened or stiff. Some people born with an 
                abnormal heart may also benefit from a heart transplant. 
                 
                A heart transplant needs to be carried out as soon as possible after a donor heart 
                becomes available. The procedure is performed under general anaesthetic where 
                the patient is unconscious.During the operation, a heart-lung bypass machine is 
                used to keep the patient alive.
                 
                A cut is made in the middle of the patient’s chest. The patient’s heart is removed, 
                leaving behind a section of the right and left atria, the two upper chambers of the 
                heart. The new heart is connected to the aorta, the pulmonary artery, and the 
                remaining part of the atria. The new heart is stimulated to start beating and the 
                patient is taken off the bypass machine.
